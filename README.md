* [Bower](http://bower.io)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

### Installation:

2. Install the Bower dependencies: `bower install`.
3. Run the gulp build task: `gulp build`.

### Development usage
Continue developing the dashboard further by editing the `src` directory. With the `gulp` command, any file changes made will automatically be compiled into the specific location within the `dist` directory.
